# Piedra, Papel y Tijera Game

His is a simple “Piedra, papel y tijera” game implemented in Python. The program prompts the user to enter ‘pi’ for “piedra”, ‘pa’ for “papel”, or ‘ti’ for “tijera”. Then, it generates a random move for the computer and compares it to the user’s input to determine the winner.

The code includes two functions: gano_el_jugador() to determine if the user won, and validar_usuario() to validate the user’s input. If the user enters an invalid input, the program prompts them to try again until they enter a valid input.

Overall, this code shows how Python can be used to create simple and fun games. It’s a great example for beginners who want to practice their coding skills and have some fun at the same time!
